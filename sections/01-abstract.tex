%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%ABSTRACT IN HERE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The goal of this experiment and report is to investigate the occurrence of the Hall effect within p-type \& n-type semiconductors. This was accomplished by use of experimental apparatus  provided by the University, to determine the Hall voltages \& voltage drops of each semiconductor under varying magnetic fields and currents. With this data the Hall coefficient $R_{H}$, resistivity $p$, number density $n$ \& Hall mobilities $\mu$ of the charge carriers for each semiconductor could be determined.
